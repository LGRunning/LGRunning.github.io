<p><strong><u>HOW TO BECOME YOUR BEST YOU</u></strong></p>

<p>You don't need to be the best. However, Working towards your best you can outwork the rest.</p>

<p>The way to do that is by having passion in what you do.</p>

<p>Having passion for the exercise you do and having passion for the vision of your best you are perfect together and this will allow you to have the discipline to do what it takes for you to achieve success in everything you do.</p>

<p><strong>REMEMBER</strong></p>

<p>People are awarded in public for what they worked for years for in private.</p>

<p>The people you idolize and the people who inspire you have done that. In order for you to do the same you must do the same as those. That's a good way of doing anything. See someone who has what you want and find out what they're doing.</p>

<p>You got to train hard, you got to train smart and when you do you'll train forever.</p>

<p>Pick something your exited about.
If you don't wake up in the morning or go through your day exited about what you choose as an exercise you'll quit. When you pick something you love to do and show up looking great you'll stick with it.
So pick something your exited about.</p>

<p>I chose running which is why my site is called 'Looking Good Running' but the same principle applies for anything you choose to do.</p>

<p>That's where it all starts.</p><br>


	<br><p><strong><u>YOU CAN DO IT.</u></strong></p>

<p>You can definitely loose weight, get thin, become healthier, look fantastic and feel great.</p>

<p>How much do you want it?</p> 

<p>When you imagine what you want take a second to realize how much you want it.</p>

<p>Ask yourself. What is most important to me in the long run? Is it really proving that you care about your life and doing all the things you want to do? Looking and feeling the way you 
want? Being able to play with your children and your nieces and nephews and even later with your 
grandchildren? Or, is TV and McDonalds more important.</p> 

<p>Really think about it. Because if you answered 
TV and McDonalds you shouldn't be reading this and you should give up now. In fact, if that's you, I
would prefer you give up now. Go back to your lazy life and forget this. This is for serious people 
who want to change their lives for the better. People who will do what it takes to become happy for 
yourself, nobody else's version of you, but YOU becoming the best version of ourself that makes YOU happy.</p>

So, whatever it takes do it. Get moving with everything you like, everything that inspires you and surround 
yourself with that throughout your day. Instead of watching Netflix. 

Netflix will still be there on your rest days.

You've got what it takes to dig down deep and find the drive. If I can do it anyone can do it.
