<p>Hi, my name is Russell Randall and I'm obsessed with helping health and fitness freaks like myself start, persivere and grow to become healthy that gives them true freedom.</p>

<p>How did I start doing this?</p>

<p>I started running in 2008. I decided to start getting thinner the way 90% of others are, and that is by being inspired by seeing fit, healthy, happy and good looking people on TV, magazines.</p>

<p>I had googled 'how to burn fat' already and I wanted to get started, so I did.</p>

<p>During my first attempt running I hit a wall pretty quickly… I woke up the next day, got out of bed, and, well, actually hit the floor. I fell flat on my face. My legs were numb and aching when I walked.</p>

<p>So, I thought about it and found a “different route”, which was to not bother with that again.</p>

<p>I learned a little about healthy eating, but it didn’t make me loose much weight, it just kept me at the weight I was originally. I wasn't putting weight on but I wasn't loosing it either. However, I did realize by this point that it did give me more energy.</p>

<p>I decided that I had another plan to get fit… I decided to learn Jeet Kun Do. I did that for about a year or so and guess what?… I got beaten up! A LOT.</p>

<p>We were pushed to our limits and beyond. Four times beyond to be exact.</p>

<p>If you were exhausted you carried on. If you were sick you cleaned it up and you carried on. If you bleed you clean it up and carry on. If you get knocked out, they brought you round,
and guess what, you carried on.</p>

<p>It was tough but I suddenly realised one day that I was at my fittest I had ever been before. I was at my strongest I'd ever been before.</p>

<p>However, my brain was looking for any excuse to give up. I decided that I couldn't justify paying my hard earned money to get a kicking 4 nights a week, so I quit. Plus I was fit now. I reached my goal. I didn't need to train anymore.</p>

<p>That was my first big mistake. I actually thought when I reached my ideal appearence that was all I had to do. The fact is it needs maintaining. There is no end. If you are in you are in forever.</p>

<p>It was only a few months after I left that the weight was piling back on. It wasn't until months after that I realised what I had done and what JKD had actually taught me.</p>
 
<p>I realised that there was what I thought I was capable of achieving and then there's really what is possible when you downright refuse to give up. There was a point that my mind would tell me to give up. And then there's what you are really capable of and how to keep pushing yourself, even when your whole being is screaming to stop, there's just something inside of you that just won't.</p>

<p>I figured I was going to start getting fit again but this time on my terms. This time with a vision of the person I really deep down want to look like..Only this time I realized getting there is the first step and staying there, keeping it was the next. That’s when I decided I was going to revisit running with a different mindset… That's when I realized it was not just something I was going to do. It was something that was going to become my life. I accepted it and that was that.</p>

<p>I started again but this time my attitude was different!</p>

<p>I fell out of bed again. When my legs stopped aching a few days later I went for a run again and over and over and I started to clean up my diet again which also gave me more and more energy and helped me heal faster.</p>

<p>This time it was going to be for an end goal but it didn't matter how long it took or what it took. This is for life anyway so it opened up my mind to just enjoy the process. I started to dress and act as if I'd already become the best looking version of myself and actually having a clear vision of what that looks like I found myself moving through the world that way even when I wasn't running. It made me look forward to running even more.</p>


<p>I didn't care how long it took, how much effort it took or what anyone else said or thought. I was obsessed and decided it was going to become my lifes goal to get there, and this time, more importantly, stay there.</p>

<p>It's funny actually how that mindset didn't make running feel like work anymore. I was glad to be going because I was on a mission for something I was passionate about.
I really wanted it and I knew it was only a matter of time before I got it.</p>

<p>I gradually learned more about nutrition and my diet to not only give me more energy but also had a huge impact on my body appearence and cut the fat burning process by half.</p>

<p>The more I learned about nutrition and what foods contained the vitamins and minirals the body needs the more I cut out all junk food altogether and swapped it for fish, meat, fruit and veg.</p>

<p>I bought lots of cook books so I could learn how to make lots of healthy meals and discovered what foods go together until I was able to throw them to one side and create my own recepes for myself.</p>

<p>Since then, I’ve been recognized by everyone who knew me as being 16 stone, I have been able to play with all the children in the family, wear clothes that would've never
 fitted me before and look and feel damn good and confident on a consistent basis, from dawn to dusk, running or not running.</p>

<p>All while maintaining a full-time job and 2 part time jobs and doing weight training some days. The best part is there was still plenty of time to watch netflix, see friends and live my life.</p><br>

<p>I couldn’t believe it! No longer was I reading about OTHER people creating a life of health and fitness freedom, I WAS DOING IT MYSELF!</p>

<p>Now, I’m determined to show you how to have a vision you can make a reality, and build your own best you that you feel so passionate about that you go and get it for yourself.</p>
