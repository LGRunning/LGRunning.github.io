<h1><strong>Encountering Dangerous Dogs On Your Run</strong></h1><br>

<p><strong><u>What to do if you are attacked by a dog.</u></strong></a></p>

<p>Have you ever been out running and a dog that's not on a lead comes running at you and is clearly not happy with you?</p>

<p>Here's some tips you can do to protect yourself and calm the situation so you can carry on your run without to much destress.</p>

<p>Where I run there is a footpath through a number of fields. It is a very popular place for dog walkers as it's open, picturesque and usually unpopulated and pieceful.</p>

<p>The entrance to each field along the path has a sign that clearly states that dogs must be kept on a lead at all times. However, most of the dog walkers choose to completely ignor that and think it's a good place to let their dogs run freely. Now, that's fine for them but when a runner like you and I have every right to be there comes along the dogs tend to see us as a threat and turn into attack mode.</p>

<p>This has happened to me a lot over the years and the way I deal with it is to just stop. Stand there with my hands up to my chin and wait for the owner to do something about it before continuing on my way. Most of the time this works fine and the owners say the same thing every time which is ''Oh sorry, he's never done that before'' or ''He doesn't like runners''. And my thoughts are that it should be on a lead, especially if the owner has no control over the animal.  
On occasions, it's not gone so well. So what do you do then?
Well, the best advice is to stop, remain calm, stay stood, don't look the animal in the eyes and try not to show fear. All these things combined should stop the dog from physically attcking you until the owner gets it under control.</p>

<p>On the rare occasion that's not enough there is advice that you kneel down and curl yourself into a tight ball so that the dog can't attack you in soft areas such as the throat and stomach. That sounds like good advice but I don't know about you but I'm sure that exposes my bum.</p>

<p>I prefer another solution which is to carry --LINK-mace/pepper spray-LINK--. At the end of the day it's not illegal, it's not dangerous to the dog and it might just save you a lot of stress. 
Feel free to add your comments and experiences. I'm fully expecting to get some stick from dog owners with this one but I think this is an important topic that should be looked into and addressed in a positive way so everyone can live and let live.</p>
